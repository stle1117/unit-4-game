CrystalsCollector Game

https://stle1117.github.io/unit-4-game/

Uses HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and CSS.
This is a game where there are four images.  Each 
image is assigned a hidden random value between 1 and 10
each time the game is initiated.  Also, a random value between
1 and 100 is displayed on the screen.  The objective is to add
the values from clicking on the images collectively to equal the value
displayed.  Exceeding the value displayed results in a loss.
Matching the value displayed results in a win.  Win and loss counts
are tracked and displayed until the page is refreshed.  If the 
page is refreshed both a new game is initiated and win and
loss counts are both reset to zero.
